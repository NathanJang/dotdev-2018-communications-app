# .dev Secretary/Communications Exec Application

Thank you for applying to be a .dev exec! Before your interview, please draft a mass email so we can get a better feel for your writing style:

*One week from now, we will have a guest speaker from Groupon coming to speak about UX design of the Groupon platform. Food is provided, and the venue has been booked. The event is open to everyone, and we want as many people to come as possible, but RSVP is required. **With this goal in mind, draft an email to the .dev mailing list.***

The details of this event are intentionally ambiguous. You should think about:

- Making the event appeal to your readers.
- What details need to be included in the email, and what don't.
- Being concise and formatting well, so that readers will get the information they need before closing the email.
- Whether you want to include any images or graphics.

If you need to make details up, go for it!

A copy of the [.dev logo][.dev logo] is included.

## Submission

You may write your response in any rich-text editor that you can show at the interview. Some ways to do this are:

- (Preferred): Editing [`email.md`][email.md] in [Markdown][Markdown] and submitting a GitHub pull request. An easy way to do this on GitHub can be found [here][PR guide].
- Writing it in your rich-text email client like Gmail, and then emailing it to us.
