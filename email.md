**Subject**: UX and Food - A Groupon Opportunity 

----
Hello everyone, 

Have you ever wondered what kinds of design choices on websites entice users to stay? On the other hand, what kinds of interface oversights make Caesar registration such a slog for everyone? If you've read this far, then congrats, you surely have a discerning eye for the conscious choices it takes for a digital medium to stand out in your email newsletter ocean!!! 

We at .dev are excited to indulge that curiosity by inviting [guest speaker name](link to speaker's LinkedIn if they have one) from Groupon to speak about UX design of the Groupon platform. If you're not familiar with Groupon, it's a web based subscription connecting customers with the coupons/deals that local merchants offer, with over 48 million active users in 2015. Everyone is invited, so bring your friends - web design choices impact anyone who uses the Internet. 

We'd like everyone coming to RSVP though - we'll have food for sure, and want to prepare effectively. You can respond going on the [Facebook event](https://www.facebook.com/) or via our [Google form](https://www.google.com/). 

The event will be held at (time), (date) in (location). 

Thanks, and have a wonderful quarter!

Best, 
Kevin Qiu
